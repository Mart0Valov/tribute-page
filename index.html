                            <h4>Tesla turbine</h4>
                            <p>The Tesla turbine is a bladeless centripetal flow turbine patented by Nikola Tesla in 1913. It is referred to as a bladeless turbine.
                            The Tesla turbine is also known as the boundary-layer turbine, cohesion-type turbine, and Prandtl-layer turbine (after Ludwig Prandtl) 
                            because it uses the boundary-layer effect and not a fluid impinging upon the blades as in a conventional turbine.

                            <h4>Tesla coil</h4>
                            <p>A Tesla coil is an electrical resonant transformer circuit designed by inventor Nikola Tesla in 1891. It is used to produce high-voltage,
                            low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity. Tesla experimented with a number of different configurations consisting of two,
                            or sometimes three, coupled resonant electric circuits.

                            <p>A Tesla valve, called a valvular conduit by its inventor, is a fixed-geometry passive check valve. It allows a fluid to flow preferentially
                            in one direction, without moving parts. The device is named after Nikola Tesla, who was awarded U.S. Patent 1,329,559 in 1920 for its invention.
                            The interior of the conduit is provided with enlargements, recesses, projections, baffles, or buckets which, while offering virtually no resistance
                            to the passage of the fluid in one direction, other than surface friction, constitute an almost impassable barrier to its flow in the opposite direction.

                            <h4>Tesla radio</h4>
                            <p>As early as 1892, Nikola Tesla created a basic design for radio. On November 8, 1898 he patented a radio controlled robot-boat.
                            Tesla's robot-boat was constructed with an antenna, which transmitted the radio waves coming from the command post where Tesla was standing.
                            Those radio waves were received by a radio sensitive device called coherer, which transmitted the radio waves into mechanical movements of
                            the propellers on the boat.

                            <p>The first AC commutator-free polyphase induction motors were independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla, a working motor model having
                            been demonstrated by the former in 1885 and by the latter in 1887. Tesla applied for US patents in October and November 1887 and was granted some of
                            these patents in May 1888.

                            <p>Since his childhood, Tesla himself had dreamed of harnessing the power of the great natural wonder. And in late 1893, his dream became a reality, when
                            Westinghouse was awarded the contract to create the powerhouse.
